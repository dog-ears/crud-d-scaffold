## How to installation and execution

### Step 1: Installing package through Composer

```
composer require dog-ears/crud-d-scaffold
```

### Step 2: Run Artisan!

You're all set.
Run `php artisan` from the console, and you'll see the new commands below.
```
- 'crud-d-scaffold:setup' : Setup crud-d-scaffold with bootstrap 3
```

  This completes the preparation.  
  Let's register the sample.  

### Step 3: Crud-D-Scaffold

##### (i) publish public resource.
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=public --force
```
##### (ii) Copy /vendor/dog-ears/crud-d-scaffold/crud-d-scaffold_case0010.json to your laravel project root
```
cp ./vendor/dog-ears/crud-d-scaffold/crud-d-scaffold_case0010.json ./crud-d-scaffold.json
```
##### (iii) run crud-d-scaffold:setup
```
php artisan crud-d-scaffold:setup -f
```
  Overwriting the file with -f option.  
  For the first time, the f option is unnecessary. (No problem with putting on)

##### (iv) run migration and seeding
```
php artisan migrate
```
```
php artisan db:seed
```

  It's all over.  
  Please check your application.

  If you want to modify the application structure,
  After running [migrate: rollback], delete the migration file (/ database / migrations /) and then
  execute [ Crud-d-scaffold: setup-f ]

## Options
-f, --force Overwrite the file. (If there is an existing file in the absence of the option, processing stops there.)



## Usage notes
* You can use laravel auth. At first [ php artisan make:auth ] and run crud-d-scaffold.
* Column names, model names, etc. are automatically converted according to the convention of laravel, so it is not possible to create singular and plural models at the same time.
